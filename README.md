# SHA

RFC 6234: US Secure Hash Algorithms (SHA and SHA-based HMAC and HKDF).

## Version

The source code (*seems to be*) from <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6234#section-8>. There is no version, so the publication date (*May 2011*) is used to form the version `2011.5.1`.

## License

The license seems to be [this](https://trustee.ietf.org/documents/trust-legal-provisions/) (*the `copyright` file*). It is not really an "Open Source", but seems to be "safe" enough. Apparently, it does not allow modifications. There is also some FAQ [here](https://trustee.ietf.org/about/faq/).
